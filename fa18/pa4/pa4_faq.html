<ol>

<li> <h3> <b>In 1a do we have to check if both parts of a binary expression is int? </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Yes. And raise a properly worded MLFailure exception otherwise.</p>


<li> <h3> <b>There is no specific constructor for Plus/Minus/Div other binary operations.</b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Use the Bin constructor for all of those.</p>

<li> <h3> <b>Does the grader care about the exact text in MLFailure exceptions?.</b> </h3>  </li>
<p> No. Put something reasonable/understandable.</p>

<li> <h3> <b>What does lookup do when it doesn't find a variable in the environment?.</b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Raise a properly worded MLFailure exception.</p>

<li> <h3> <b>Do we have to ensure that the then and else branch of an if have the same type as in ocaml?</b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Nope. </p>

<li> <h3> <b>Do we have to worry about the type of a list i.e. that all elements have the same type?</b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Only if it is used in an ill-typed manner. For example <tt>let mixed = [1;false]</tt> is fine but <tt>(hd mixed) && true </tt> should throw an error.   </p>

<li> <h3> <b>Do we have to worry about the arguments of map/fold?</b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Again, only if it is used in an ill-typed manner. For example <tt>let badIfUsed = map true</tt> is fine because it is never used, even though map expects a function but boolean foo is not a function. However, <tt>badIfUsed [1]</tt> should throw an error.</p>

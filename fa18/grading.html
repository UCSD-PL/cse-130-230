        <h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
      </div>

     <ul class="lead">
      <li>Cheating WILL be taken seriously. It is not fair toward honest
          students to take cheating lightly, nor is it fair to the
          cheater to let him/her go on thinking that cheating is a
          reasonable alternative in life.</li>
      <li>The following is not considered cheating:
       <ul>
        <li>
         discussing broad ideas about programming assignments in groups, without being at a computer (with code-writing and debugging done individually, later).
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The following is considered cheating:
       <ul>
         <li>discussing programming assignments with someone who has already completed the problem, or looking at their completed solution.</li>
         <li>looking at anyone else’s solution</li>
         <li>looking at solutions from the web, previous versions of the class, or anywhere else.</li>
         <li>leaving your code (for example in an online repository) visible to others, leading others to look at your solution.</li>
         <li>receiving, providing, or soliciting assistance from unauthorized sources during a test.</li>
       </ul>
      </li>

      <li> Programming assignments are not intended to be grade-makers,
           but to prepare you for the tests, which are the
           grade-makers. Cheating on the programming assignment is not
           only unethical, but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of
           the purpose of these assignments.</li>

      <li>Penalties: If the teaching staff become aware of any violations of these
          rules by a student I will initiate the actions described in
          the <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/">Policy on
          Academic Integrity</a>. If found responsible, the academic sanctions may result in a
          zero for the assignment, a zero for that portion of your
          grade, an “F” in the course, among others.</li>
     </ul>

<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li><b>Midterm exam</b> will be held sometime in the middle of the -->

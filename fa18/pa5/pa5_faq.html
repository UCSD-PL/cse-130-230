<ol>

<li> <h3> <b>  Can we create helper rules? </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Yes. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> I output all the correct values, but in different order from the problem writeup. Is this ok?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Yes. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> How to I store all things matching a query in a list?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Read the documentation for bagof. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> Can we use findall? How is it different from bagof?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> You can use either. For the purposes of this assignment they are very similar. A good example of their differences can be found here:

</p>

<li> <h3> <b> What does \= mean?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Means that the two terms cannot be unified. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> Is there length in Prolog?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> You have to implement it if you want to use it. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> Can we use sum_list?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Nope. That would be no fun. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> Having trouble with arithmetic! Why does this happen:

<pre>
helper(One,Two,Three) :- Three = One + Two.
?- helper(1,X,4).
false.
?- helper(X,Y,Z).
Z = X+Y.
</pre> ?</b> </h3>  </li>
<p> The "=" sign does not signify arithmetic equality, instead it performs unification. You probably want the "is" keyword. </p>


<li> <h3> <b> What additional tests should I run?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Get creative! The usual suspects such as empty lists, and substituting things with variables are good things to try. </p>

To download and install the latest 3.6.x version of Python on your home machines
see <a href="http://www.python.org/downloads">this page</a>.  Remember
that this is only to enable you to play with the assignment at home:
The final version turned in must work on the ACS Linux machines.

While you can use MacOS or Windows to begin working with Python, the
code you turn in must be that required for the Linux environment.

<h3 align="center"><b>Code Documentation and General Requirements</b></h3>
<p>Code for all programming assignments should be <b>well
documented</b>. A working program with no comments will <b>receive
only partial credit</b>. Documentation entails providing documentation
strings for all methods, classes, packages, etc., and comments
throughout the code to explain the program logic. Comments in Python
are preceded by <tt>#</tt> and extend to the end of the line.
Documentation strings are strings in the first line of a function,
method, etc., and are accessible using <tt>help(foo)</tt>, where foo
is the name of the method, class, etc.  It is understood that some of
the exercises in this programming assignment require extremely little
code and will not require extensive comments.

<p>While few programming assignments pretend to mimic the &quot;real&quot;
world, they may, nevertheless, contain some of the ambiguity that exists
outside the classroom. If, for example, an assignment is amenable to
differing interpretations, such that more than one algorithm may implement
a correct solution to the assignment, it is incumbent upon the
programmer to document not only the functionality of the algorithm (and
more broadly his/her interpretation of the program requirements), but to
articulate <b>clearly</b> the reasoning behind a particular choice of
solution.</p>


<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3 align="center">Assignment Overview</h3>

<p>The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to some more
advanced features of Python.  This assignment will cover topics from
classes and OOP, the decorator pattern, and parsing and typechecking.
</p>

The assignment is available as a zip file <a href="pa7.zip">pa7.zip</a> for you to download.


<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3 align="center">Assignment Testing and Evaluation</h3>
<p>Your functions/programs <b>must</b> compile and/or run on a <b>Linux</b> ACS machine (e.g. <tt>ieng6.ucsd.edu</tt>), 
  as this is where the verification of your solutions will occur. While 
  you may develop your code on any system, ensure that your code runs as 
  expected on an ACS machine prior to submission.
    You should test your code in the directories from 
  which the zip files (see below) will be created, as this will approximate the 
  environment used for grading the assignment.</p>

  <p>Most of the points, except those for comments and style, will be <b>awarded 
  automatically, by evaluating your functions against a given test suite</b>. 
  The file, <tt> test.py </tt> contains a very small suite of tests which 
  gives you a flavor of these tests. At any stage, by typing at the UNIX
  shell : <br>
  <blockquote>
    <code> python3 test.py </code>
  </blockquote>
    you will get a report on how your code stacks up against the simple
    tests. 
    </p>
  <p> The last (or near the bottom) line of the file <tt>log</tt> <b> must contain the word
    "Compiled" otherwise you get a zero for the whole assignment</b>.
  If for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile, leave it as is with the 
  <tt>raise ...</tt>, with your partial solution enclosed below as a comment.
  <b> There will be no exceptions to this rule</b>.
  You are encouraged to try to understand the code in <tt>test.py</tt>, and
  subsequently devise your own tests and add them to <tt>test.py</tt>, but
  you will not be graded on this.
</p>
  <p>Alternately, inside the Python shell, type (user input is in <font color="#FF000">red</font>):
    <blockquote>
      <code> &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000"> import test </font><br>
	.<br>
	.<br>
  .<br>
</code>

<a name="Submission Guidelines"></a>
<h3 align="center">Submission Instructions</h3>
  
<h3>1. Create the zip file for submission</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your solutions to this assignment will be stored in separate 
  files under a directory called <tt>pa7_solution/</tt>, inside which you will 
  place the files: 
  <tt> decorators.py, nano.py, nanoParser.py, types.pl </tt>. 
  These four files listed are the versions of the 
  corresponding supplied files that you will have modified.
  There should be <b>no other files in the directory</b>.</p>
  
  <p>After creating and populating the directory as described above,
  create a zip file called 
  <tt>&lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa7.zip</tt> by going into 
  the directory <tt>pa6_solution</tt> and executing
  the UNIX shell command: <br> 
  <blockquote>
    <tt> zip &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa7.zip *</tt>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>2. Test the zip file to check for its validity</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once you've created the zip file with your solutions, you will
  use the <tt> validate_pa7</tt> program to see whether your zip
  file's structure is well-formed to be inspected by our grading
  system by executing the UNIX shell command: <br>
  <blockquote><tt>
    validate_pa7 &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa7.zip
  </tt></blockquote>
  The <tt>validate_pa7</tt> program will output <tt>OK</tt> if your
  zip file is well-formed and your solution is compiled. 
  Otherwise, it will output some error
  messages. Before going to step 3, make sure that your zip file
  passes <tt>validate_pa7</tt> program. <b>Otherwise 
  you get a zero for the whole assignment.</b>
  If you have any trouble with
  this, refer to the instructions in step 1.
</blockquote>
  
<h3>3. Submit the zip file via the <tt>turnin_pa7</tt> program</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once you've created the zip file with your solutions,
  you will use the <tt>turnin</tt> program to submit
  this file for grading by going into the directory <tt>pa7_solution/</tt> 
  and executing the UNIX shell command: <br>
  <blockquote><tt> turnin_pa7
      &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa7.zip </tt>
  </blockquote>
    </p>
  <p>
  The <tt>turnin_pa7</tt> program will provide you with a confirmation of the
  submission process; make sure that the size of the file indicated by
  <tt>turnin_pa7</tt> matches the size of your zip file. Note that you may submit multiple times, but your latest submission overwrites previous submissions, and will be the ONLY one we grade. If you submit before the assignment deadline, and again afterwards, we will count it as if you only submitted after the deadline. </p>

</ul>

<hr size=10 noshade>

<h2>Problem #0: Documentation</h2> 

None of the functions in this assignment are documented (except the
Failure exception).  You are expected to document all modules (.py
files), all classes, and all public functions with doc strings.  Doc
strings should describe the behavior of the function/class/module.
For example:
<blockquote>
 "The function prod takes two integers and returns their product".
</blockquote>
If the implementation is not straightforward and obvious,
there should be comments.  For example:
<blockquote>
<code># prod is implemented using a FFT to get O(n log n) time</code>
</blockquote>

Once documented you should get the following behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">import decorators</font></br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">help(decorators)</font><br>
    <i>Screen full of documentation with all your doc strings</i><br>
 </tt></p>

<h2>Problem #1: Typechecking NanoML <tt>(nano.py, nanoParser.py, types.pl)</tt></h2>

<p>
In this problem, you will write a <i>type-inference</i> algorithm for the NanoML language of PA4. 
Type-inference is very naturally expressed in Prolog and so you will implement the logic of your algorithm in a Prolog file, <tt>types</tt>.
You will also reuse the project from PA4, provided in the <tt>nano/</tt> directory, to parse NanoML programs.
Finally, you will use Python to coordinate between OCaml and Prolog, and to hold the results of the type-inference algorithm.
</p>

<p>
  This assignment is structured as follows. <tt>nano.py</tt> defines a class hierarchy for NanoML expressions and types. <tt> nanoParser.py</tt> contains parsers functions for this hierarchy.
  <tt>types.pl</tt> contains an (unimplemented) type-inference algorithm for NanoML expressions.
  The <tt>nano/</tt> directory contains the NanoML assignment from PA4, modified to build expressions in <tt>nano.py</tt>. 
  Finally, the <tt>nanoTypes.py</tt> file interfaces between the various languages. The <b>only</b> files you will need to modify
  are <tt>nano.py, types.pl, and nanoParser.py</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the provided Python code relies on the OCaml library in <tt>nano/</tt>. You will need to build this library before running many commands; to do this, <tt>cd</tt> into the <tt>nano/</tt> directory and run <tt>make</tt>.
</p>

<h3>(a)<b> OCaml to Python: 10 + 10 points </b></h3>

<p>
First, you will implement the code for converting NanoML expressions to their corresponding 
representation in Python. We have provided a modified <tt>nano/</tt> project (and in particular, <tt>nano/nanoml.byte</tt>) 
which emits Python constructors for NanoML expressions, as well as the <tt>nanoParser.py</tt> functions <tt>parseNano</tt> and <tt>fileToNano</tt>, which
invoke the <tt>nano</tt> project to build Python <tt>Expressions</tt>. For the first part of the assignment, you will
implement constructors (i.e. <tt>__init__</tt>) for the OCaml <tt>Expression</tt> and <tt>Bop</tt> classes in <tt>nano.py</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
  Your constructors should always handle the output of <tt>nano/nanoml.byte</tt>. You can check this by running <tt>nano/nanoml.byte</tt> by command line, e.g.
</p>
<blockquote>
  $ <font color="#FF0000">./nano/nanoml.byte "foo bar"</font><br>
  App(Var("foo"),Var("bar"))$ <br>
  $ <font color="#FF0000">./nano/nanoml.byte "1+2"</font><br>
  Bin(Const(1),Plus(),Const(2))$<br>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also check your implementation by running <tt>nanoParser.fileToNano</tt> or <tt>nanoParser.parseNano</tt> from a python3 prompt, e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">import nanoParser</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">nanoParser.parseNano("if true then 1 else 0")</font><br>
    If(Bool(True),Const(1),Const(0))<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">nanoParser.fileToNano("nano/tests/t1.ml")</font><br>
    Bin(Bin(Const(2),Const(3),Plus()),Bin(Const(4),Const(5),Plus()),Mul())<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition, observe that <tt>Expression.__repr__</tt> is defined in terms of <tt>Expression.ctor</tt>, by using <tt>ctor</tt> to calculate
a constructor call from the expression's class and string arguments. We have provided a skeleton implementation of <tt>ctor</tt> -- modify the skeleton
<tt>ctor</tt> such that <tt>__repr__</tt> produces identical output to <tt>nano/nanoml.byte</tt>. 

<h3>(b)<b> NanoML Types: 10 points </b></h3>

<p>
Next, you will implement a class for representing types of NanoML expressions. There are four types of values in NanoML: ints, bools, lists, and functions, which are modeled in <tt>nano.py</tt> by the <tt>Type</tt> class hierarchy.
In addition, variables can be <tt>weakly-polymorphic</tt>, i.e. polymorphic until used, which is modeled by the <tt>VarTy</tt> class.
</p>

<p>
  Implement the constructors (i.e. <tt>__init__</tt>) for <tt>Type</tt>; <tt>ListTy</tt> takes a type as argument, <tt>ArrowTy</tt> takes two types as argument, <tt>VarTy</tt> takes a string argument, and the 
  remaining constructors do not take arguments.
</p>
<blockquote>
  $ <font color="#FF0000">./nano/nanoml.byte "foo bar"</font><br>
  App(Var("foo"),Var("bar"))$ <br>
  $ <font color="#FF0000">./nano/nanoml.byte "1+2"</font><br>
  Bin(Const(1),Plus(),Const(2))$<br>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also check your implementation by running <tt>nanoParser.fileToNano</tt> or <tt>nanoParser.parseNano</tt> from a python3 prompt, e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">import nanoParser</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">nanoParser.parseNano("if true then 1 else 0")</font><br>
    If(Bool(True),Const(1),Const(0))<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">nanoParser.fileToNano("nano/tests/t1.ml")</font><br>
    Bin(Bin(Const(2),Const(3),Plus()),Bin(Const(4),Const(5),Plus()),Mul())<br>
</blockquote>

<h2>Problem #2: Decorators <tt>(decorators.py)</tt></h2>

Here are some links on <tt>*args</tt> and <tt>**args</tt>
<a href="http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/01/how-to-use-args-and-kwargs-in-python/">tutorial</a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists">python 
manual</a>.

In the file <code>decorators.py</code> there is an example decorator,
<code>profiled</code> and stub code for decorators that you will be
writing.  At the bottom of the file are many examples of decorated
functions.  The expected output for these functions is available here:
<a href="decorators.out">decorators.out</a>.

<h3>(a)<b> 30 points </b></h3>

Complete the definition for the decorator <code>traced</code>.  When
the decorated function is called, the decorator should print out an
ASCII art tree of the recursive calls and their return values.  The
format of the tree should be as follows:

<ol>

<li>Print a pipe symbol followed by a space ("<code>| </code>") for every level of
nested function calls.

<li>Print a comma then a minus sign then a space ("<code>,- </code>") next.

<li>Print the name of the function being traced followed by an open
parenthesis followed by the <code>repr()</code> of all of the
arguments.  Arguments should be seperated by a comma followed by a
space ("<code>, </code>").  After the normal arguments, print all the
keyword arguments in the form keyword then equals sign then
<code>repr()</code> of the value of the keyword argument.  The keyword
arguments should also be seperated by a comma followed by a space.
Keyword arguments should be printed in the order returnd by
<code>dict.items()</code>.

<li>Next increase the nesting level and call the function itself.

<li>At the original nesting level, print a pipe symbol followed by a
space ("<code>| </code>") for every level of nested function calls.

<li>Print a backquote then a minus sign then a space("<code>`- </code>").

<li>Finally, print the <code>repr()</code> of the return value.

</ol>

The return value of the function should be return to the caller after
all printing is complete.  If an exception occurs in the funciton, the
nesting level must be adjusted to the appropriate level where the
exception is caught.  See <code>change</code> for an example.
</p>

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">from decorators import *</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">@traced</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">def foo(a,b):</font><br>
    ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">if a==0: return b</font><br>
    ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">return foo(b=a-1,a=b-1)</font><br>
    ...<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">foo(4,5)</font>
<pre>
,- foo(4, 5)
| ,- foo(a=4, b=3)
| | ,- foo(a=2, b=3)
| | | ,- foo(a=2, b=1)
| | | | ,- foo(a=0, b=1)
| | | | `- 1
| | | `- 1
| | `- 1
| `- 1
`- 1
1
</pre>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(b)<b> 30 points </b></h3>

<p>
Complete the definition of the <code>memoized</code> decorator.  When
the decorated function is called, the decorator should check to see if
the function has already been called with the given arguments.  If so,
the decorator should return the value the the function returned when
it was last called with the given arguments.  If the function last
threw an exception when called with the given arguments, the same
exception should be thrown again.  If the function has not been called
with the given arguments, then call it and record the return value or
exception.  Then return the return value or raise the thrown
exception.
</p>

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">from decorators import *</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">from time import sleep</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">@memoized</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">def foo(a):</font><br>
    ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">sleep(a)</font><br>
    ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">return a</font><br>
    ...<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">foo(5)</font><br>
    <i># 5 second pause</i><br>
    5<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">foo(5)</font><br>
    <i># practically instantaneous</i><br>
    5<br>
 </tt></p>

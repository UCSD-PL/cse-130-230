<h1 align="center"> CSE 130 - Programming Assignment #5 FAQ </h1>
<ol>
<li> <h3> <b>Is the Fractional Credit for 2e) extra credit? </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> No its not extra credit. Its part of the grade. </p>

<li> <h3> <b>How is the Fractional Credit for 2e) graded? </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Read the assignment. Its specified there. </p>


<li> <h3> <b> I'm getting Indentation errors, but my indentation looks fine? </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> The python interpreter differentiates between spaces and TAB-s. So even
though two lines may look like they are indented the same width, if one is done
with spaces, and the other with TAB-s python will complain. Make sure to be
consistent and only use one or the other. One way to get your code to
consistently use spaces, is to open it in vim and run the command ":retab"</p>

<li> <h3> <b> Can I import other libraries than what already is there?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> No. You may only use the imporated libraries and the <a
href='https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html'>built-in functions
</a>.</p>


<li> <h3> <b> For 1a) can we assume the list is sorted?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> No.</p>

<li> <h3> <b> For 1a) can numbers be negative?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Yes.</p>

<li> <h3> <b> For 1b) can lists be of different length?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> No. You can assume lists are of equal length. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> What if in 1b) we have repeating keys?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Assign the value corresponding to the last occurance of the key. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> What if in 1b) we have repeating keys?  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Assign the value corresponding to the last occurance of the key. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> Can't open/load words/wrods.txt in 2a)  </b> </h3>  </li>
<p> Make sure that 1) the file words is in the same directory as the scripts 2) you are correctly calling load_words("words"). If you save it as words.txt, you would have to call load_words("words.txt"). </p>


<li> <h3> <b> If I crack all passwords given in the assignment file, do I get
full credit?  </b> </h3>  </li> <p> Not necessarily. If you can crack all
passwords, you will likely get at least 15 points, since you can probably crack
all UNTRANSFORMED passwords. We will be testing your code against a much bigger
set of passwords, with a time limit. As described in the assignment, your score
will be proportional to how many passwords you crack, relative to the best
student. </p>

<li> <h3> <b> How much time will our programs be given for 2e)?  </b> </h3>  </li> <p> 5 min. </p>
<li> <h3> <b> In 2b) transform_capitalize can the word contain non-letters(e.g. numbers)? What should we do about those?  </b> </h3>  </li> <p> Yes it can. You should leave them unchanged, since they obviously can't be capitalized. Notice that upper() won't change anything that is not a letter. Try typing "a3b".upper() in a python shell.  </p>

<h3 align="center">Integrity of Scholarship</h3>
<p>University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly
enforced. By completing this assignment, you implicitly agree to
abide by the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship described 
in the
<a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/front/AcadRegu.html">Academic Regulations</a>, 
in particular &quot;all academic work will be
done by the student to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any
kind.&quot;</p> <p>You are expected to do your own work on this assignment;
there are no group projects in this course. You may (and are
encouraged to) engage in general discussions with your classmates regarding
the assignment, but specific details of a solution, including the solution
itself, must always be your own work. Incidents that violate the
University's rules on integrity of scholarship will be taken seriously:
In addition to receiving a zero (0) on the assignment, students 
may also face other penalties, up to and including, expulsion from the 
University. Should you have any doubt about the moral and/or ethical 
implications of an activity associated with the completion of this assignment, 
please see the instructors.</p>

<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3 align="center"><b>Code Documentation and General Requirements</b></h3>
<p>Code for all programming assignments should be <b>well
documented</b>. A working program with no comments will <b>receive
only partial credit</b>. Documentation entails providing documentation
strings for all methods, classes, packages, etc., and comments
throughout the code to explain the program logic. Comments in Python
are preceded by <tt>#</tt> and extend to the end of the line.
Documentation strings are strings in the first line of a function,
method, etc., and are accessible using <tt>help(foo)</tt>, where foo
is the name of the method, class, etc.  It is understood that some of
the exercises in this programming assignment require extremely little
code and will not require extensive comments.

<p>While few programming assignments pretend to mimic the &quot;real&quot;
world, they may, nevertheless, contain some of the ambiguity that exists
outside the classroom. If, for example, an assignment is amenable to
differing interpretations, such that more than one algorithm may implement
a correct solution to the assignment, it is incumbent upon the
programmer to document not only the functionality of the algorithm (and
more broadly his/her interpretation of the program requirements), but to
articulate <b>clearly</b> the reasoning behind a particular choice of
solution.</p>


<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3 align="center">Assignment Overview</h3>

<p>The overall objective of this assignment is to introduce you to
Python.  Emphasis will be placed on text and string manipulations and should use 
some of Python's facilities for iterating over structures.

The assignment is spread over three python files 
<a href="misc.py">misc.py</a>,
<a href="crack.py">crack.py</a>,
<a href="test.py">test.py</a>, and three files 
<a href="words">words</a>,
<a href="passwd">passwd</a>, and
<a href="news.txt">news.txt</a>
that you need to download.

The first three files contain several skeleton Python functions, with missing
bodies, i.e. expressions, which currently contain the text
<code> raise Failure("to be written")</code>. 

Your task is to replace the text in those files with the the
appropriate Python code for each of those expressions.  An emphasis
should be placed on writing concise easy to read code.



<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3 align="center">Assignment Testing and Evaluation</h3>
<p>Your functions/programs <b>must</b> compile and/or run on a <b>Linux</b> ACS machine (e.g. <tt>ieng6.ucsd.edu</tt>), 
  as this is where the verification of your solutions will occur. While 
  you may develop your code on any system, ensure that your code runs as 
  expected on an ACS machine prior to submission.
    You should test your code in the directories from 
  which the zip files (see below) will be created, as this will approximate the 
  environment used for grading the assignment.</p>

  <p>Most of the points, except those for comments and style, will be <b>awarded 
  automatically, by evaluating your functions against a given test suite</b>. 
  The fourth file, <tt> test.py </tt> contains a very small suite of tests which 
  gives you a flavor of these tests. At any stage, by typing at the UNIX
  shell : <br>
  <blockquote>
    <code> python < test.py | grep "130>>" > log </code>
  </blockquote>
    you will get a report on how your code stacks up against the simple
    tests. 
    </p>
  <p> The last (or near the bottom) line of the file <tt>log</tt> <b> must contain the word
    "Compiled" otherwise you get a zero for the whole assignment</b>.
  If for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile, leave it as is with the 
  <tt>raise ...</tt>, with your partial solution enclosed below as a comment.
  <b> There will be no exceptions to this rule</b>.
  The second last line of the log file will contain your overall score, and the 
  other lines will give you a readout for each test.
  You are encouraged to try to understand the code in <tt>test.py</tt>, and
  subsequently devise your own tests and add them to <tt>test.py</tt>, but
  you will not be graded on this.
</p>
  <p>Alternately, inside the Python shell, type (user input is in <font color="#FF000">red</font>):
    <blockquote>
      <code> &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000"> import test </font><br>
	.<br>
	.<br>
	.<br>
	130&gt;&gt; Results: ...<br>
	130&gt;&gt; Compiled
	</code>
      </blockquote>
      and it should print a pair of integers, reflecting your score and
      the max possible score on the sample tests. If instead an error
      message appears, your code will receive a zero.
      </p>

<a name="Submission Guidelines"></a>
<h3 align="center">Submission Instructions</h3>
  
<h3>1. Create the zip file for submission</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your solutions to this assignment will be stored in separate 
  files under a directory called <tt>pa5_solution/</tt>, inside which you will 
  place the files: 
  <tt> misc.py, crack.py </tt>. 
  These two files listed are the versions of the 
  corresponding supplied files that you will have modified.
  There should be <b>no other files in the directory</b>.</p>
  
  
  <p>After creating and populating the directory as described above,
  create a zip file called 
  <tt>&lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa5.zip</tt> by going into 
  the directory <tt>pa5_solution</tt> and executing
  the UNIX shell command: <br> 
  <blockquote>
    <tt> zip &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa5.zip *</tt>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>


<h3>2. Test the zip file to check for its validity</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once you've created the zip file with your solutions, you will
  use the <tt> validate_pa5</tt> program to see whether your zip
  file's structure is well-formed to be inspected by our grading
  system by executing the UNIX shell command: <br>
  <blockquote><tt> validate_pa5 &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa5.zip </tt>
  </blockquote>
  The <tt>validate_pa5</tt> program will output <tt>OK</tt> if your
  zip file is well-formed and your solution is compiled. 
  Otherwise, it will output some error
  messages. Before going to step 3, make sure that your zip file
  passes <tt>validate_pa5</tt> program. <b>Otherwise 
  you get a zero for the whole assignment.</b>
  If you have any trouble with
  this, refer to the instructions in step 1.
</blockquote>


  
  <h3>3. Submit the zip file via the <tt>turnin_pa5</tt> program</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once you've created the zip file with your solutions,
  you will use the <tt>turnin_pa5</tt> program to submit
  this file for grading by going into the directory <tt>pa5_solution/</tt> 
  and executing the UNIX shell command: <br>
  <blockquote><tt> turnin_pa5
      &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa5.zip </tt>
  </blockquote>
    </p>
  <p>
  The <tt>turnin_pa5</tt> program will provide you with a confirmation of the
  submission process; make sure that the size of the file indicated by
  <tt>turnin_pa5</tt> matches the size of your zip file. (turnin_pa5 is a thin wrapper script around the ACMS command  <tt> <a href="http://acs.ucsd.edu/info/turnin.php">turnin</a></tt> that repeats validation and ensures that the propper assignment name is passed). Note that you may submit multiple times, but your latest submission overwrites previous submissions, and will be the ONLY one we grade. If you submit before the assignment deadline, and again afterwards, we will count it as if you only submitted after the deadline.

<h2>Problem #1: Warm-Up </a>
<tt> (misc.py) </tt>
</h2>
<h3>(a)<b> 10 points </b></h3>
<p>Write a function <tt> closest_to(l,v) </tt>,
which returns the element of the list <tt>l</tt> closest in value to
<tt>v</tt>.  In the case of a tie, the first such element is returned.
If l is empty, None is returned.

Once implemented you should get the following behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">from misc import *</font> # this will load everything in misc.py</br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">closest_to([2,4,8,9],7)</font><br>
    8<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">closest_to([2,4,8,9],5)</font><br>
    4<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(b)<b> 10 points </b></h3>

<p>Now, write a function <tt>make_dict(keys,vals)</tt> which takes a
list of keys and a list of values and returns a dictionary
(<tt>dict</tt>) pairing keys to corresponding values.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">make_dict(["foo","baz"],["bar","blah"])</font><br>
    {'foo': 'bar', 'baz': 'blah'}<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">make_dict([1],[100])</font><br>
    {1: 100}<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>


<h3>(c)<b> 10 points </b></h3>
<p>Write a Python function <tt>word_count(filename)</tt> that
takes a string, <tt>filename</tt>, and returns a dictionary mapping
words to the number of times they occur in the file <tt>filename</tt>.
For this function, a word is defined as a sequence of alphanumeric
characters and underscore.  All other characters should be ignored.
Words should be returned in lower case, and case should be ignored
when counting occurrences.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">word_count("news.txt")</font><br> 
    {'all': 2, 'code': 2, 'gupta': 1, 'results': 1, 'four': 1, 'edu': 2, ...}<br>
 </tt></p>

<h2>Problem #2: Password Cracking
<tt>(crack.py)</tt></h2>

For this problem, you will write a simple dictionary based password
cracker.  This should primarily be an exercise in string manipulation
and data structures.  You will be attempting to crack as many
passwords as possible in a UNIX password file.  The passwords are
encrypted using the UNIX <tt>crypt()</tt> function.  For more
information see <a
href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man5/passwd.5.php"><tt>man 5
passwd</tt></a> and <a
href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man3/crypt.3.php"><tt>man 3
crypt</tt></a> on UNIX or Linux.  In addition, more information will
be provided when used.

<h3>(a)<b> 10 points </b></h3>

<p>Write a Python function <tt>load_words(filename,regexp)</tt> which
loads the words from the file <tt>filename</tt> which match the
regular expression <tt>regexp</tt>.  There will be one word per line
in the input file.  The resulting words should be returned in a list
in the same order they occur in the input file.</p>

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">from crack import *</font><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">load_words("words",r"^[A-Z].{2}$")</font><br>
    ['A-1', 'AAA', 'AAE', ...]<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">load_words("words",r"^xYx.*$")</font><br>
    []<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(b) <b>5 + 10 + 15 points</b></h3>

<p>Write three python functions to implement the following string
transformations: <tt>transform_reverse</tt>, <tt>transform_capitalize</tt>, 
and <tt>transform_digits</tt>.  Each
will take a string as an argument and return a list of strings.  The
order of returned strings does not matter.</p>

<p>The first function, <tt>transform_reverse(str)</tt> should return a
list with the original string and the reversal of the original string.</p>

<p>The second function, <tt>transform_capitalize(str)</tt> should
return a list of all the possible ways to capitalize the input string.</p>

<p>Finally, the third function, <tt>transform_digits(str)</tt> should
return return a list of all possible ways to replace letters with
similar looking digits according to the following mappings.  This
should be done without regard to the capitalization of the input
string, however when a character is not replaced with a digit, it's
capitalization should be preserved.</p>

<blockquote>
<table border=2 cellpadding=2><tr><td>o -&gt; 0</td><td>i,l -&gt; 1</td></tr>
<tr><td> z -&gt; 2 </td><td> e -&gt; 3 </td></tr>
<tr><td> a -&gt; 4 </td><td> s -&gt; 5 </td></tr>
<tr><td> b -&gt; 6 </td><td> t -&gt; 7 </td></tr>
<tr><td> b -&gt; 8 </td><td> g,q -&gt; 9 </td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt (order of list elements is not important):
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">transform_reverse("Moose")</font><br>
    ['Moose','esooM']<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">transform_capitalize("foo")</font><br>
    ['foo', 'Foo', 'fOo', 'FOo', 'foO', 'FoO', 'fOO', 'FOO']<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">transform_digits("Bow")</font><br>
    ['Bow', 'B0w', '6ow', '60w', '8ow', '80w']<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(c) <b>10 points</b></h3>

<p>Write a function <tt>check_pass(plain,enc)</tt> which will take a
plain-text password, <tt>plain</tt>, and an encrypted password
<tt>enc</tt> and will return <tt>True</tt> if <tt>plain</tt> encrypts
to <tt>enc</tt> using the function crypt.</p>

<p>Crypt is available in Python in the <tt>crypt</tt> module.  You can
load this modules with <tt>import crypt</tt>.  Then the crypt function
is available as <tt>crypt.crypt()</tt>.  See
<tt>help(crypt.crypt)</tt> in Python.  When crypt is used, a salt must
be provided to perturb the algorithm.  This salt is a random two
character string which is returned in the beginning of the password.
Since you are going in the other direction, you should extract the
salt from the first two characters of the encrypted password (or see
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-crypt.html">here</a> for
more information).</p>

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">check_pass("asarta","IqAFDoIjL2cDs")</font><br>
    True<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">check_pass("foo","AAbcdbcdzyxzy")</font><br>
    False<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(d) <b>10 points</b></h3>

<p>Now, write a Python function <tt>load_passwd(filename)</tt> which
takes a string as input and returns a list of dictionaries with fields
"account", "password", "UID", "GID", "GECOS", "directory", and
"shell", each mapping to the corresponding field of the file.  The UID
and GID fields should be returned as integers.  The password file
contains lines of the following format (see <a
href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man5/passwd.5.php">here</a> for
more information):</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>account:password:UID:GID:GECOS:directory:shell</tt>
</blockquote>

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">load_passwd("passwd")</font><br>
    [{'account': 'root', 'shell': '/bin/bash', 'UID': 0, 'GID': 0, 'GECOS': 'Corema Latterll', 'directory': '/home/root', 'password': 'VgzdTLne0kfs6'}, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;... ]<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>
<i>Hint:</i> The function <tt>re.split</tt> may be of use.<br>

<h3>(e) <b>15 points + 25 points fractional credit</b></h3>

<p>Finally, write a function
<tt>crack_pass_file(filename,words,out)</tt> which takes two strings
corresponding to a password file and a file with a list of words and a
string corresponding to an output file.  Attempt to crack as many of
the passwords in the password file as possible.  As passwords are
discovered, they should be written to the output file in the following
format:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>username</i><tt>=</tt><i>pass</i><br>
</blockquote>
for example,
<blockquote>
<tt>checani=asarta</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>After each line is written, the output file should be flushed.
Your function will only be allowed to run for a limited amount of time
(several minutes).  Thus, you should attempt to crack the easiest
passwords first.  All passwords in the input file are between 6 and 8
characters and can be cracked using words in the provided dictionary
along with a combination of the transformations above.  The base
points will be provided if all the passwords which are untransformed
strings can be cracked.  Fractional credit will be proportional to the
number of additional passwords cracked, with <i>the student cracking 
the most extra words getting the full 25 points</i>.</p>

<p>Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the Python prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <font color="#FF0000">crack_pass_file("passwd","words","out")</font><br>
    <i>Several minutes pass...</i><br>
    <font color="#FF0000">Ctrl-C</font><br>
    Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
    ...<br>
    KeyboardInterrupt<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

The file <tt>out</tt> should contain something like the following:

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
  checani=asarta<br>
  root=...<br>
  ...=...<br>
  ...=...<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

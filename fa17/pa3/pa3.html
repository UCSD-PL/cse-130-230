<b>Note:</b>
See <a href="../misc/ocaml/info_ocaml.html"> this </a> for instructions on
starting OCaml in the ACS lab machines.
To download and install OCaml version on your home machines see the 
instructions <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html">here</a>. 
Remember that this is only to enable you to play with the assignment 
at home: the final version turned in must work on the ACS Linux machines.



<b>Note:</b>
While you can use windows to begin working with OCaml, the code you
turn in must be that required for the ACS Linux environment.

<h3 align="center">Integrity of Scholarship</h3>
<p>University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly
enforced. By completing this assignment, you implicitly agree to
abide by the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship described beginning on
page 62 of the Academic Regulations section (<a
href="http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/pdfs/regulations.pdf">PDF</a>) of the
2002-2003 General Catalog, in particular, &quot;all academic work will be
done by the student to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any
kind.&quot;</p> <p>You are expected to do your own work on this assignment;
there are no group projects in this course. You may (and are
encouraged to) engage in general discussions with your classmates regarding
the assignment, but specific details of a solution, including the solution
itself, must always be your own work. Incidents that violate the
University's rules on integrity of scholarship will be taken seriously:
In addition to receiving a zero (0) on the assignment, students 
may also face other penalties, up to and including, expulsion from the 
University. Should you have any doubt about the moral and/or ethical 
implications of an activity associated with the completion of this assignment, 
please see the instructors.</p>

<h3 align="center"><b>Code Documentation and General Requirements</b></h3>
<p>Code for all programming assignments should be <b>well
documented</b>. A working program with no comments will <b>receive
only partial credit</b>. Documentation entails writing a description
of each function/method, class/structure, as well as comments throughout
the code to explain  the program logic. Comments in OCaml/NJ are enclosed
within (* *), and may be nested. 
It is understood that some of the exercises in this programming assignment
require extremely little code and will not require extensive comments.

<p>While few programming assignments pretend to mimic the &quot;real&quot;
world, they may, nevertheless, contain some of the ambiguity that exists
outside the classroom. If, for example, an assignment is amenable to
differing interpretations, such that more than one algorithm may implement
a correct solution to the assignment, it is incumbent upon the
programmer to document not only the functionality of the algorithm (and
more broadly his/her interpretation of the program requirements), but to
articulate <b>clearly</b> the reasoning behind a particular choice of
solution.</p>


<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3 align="center">Assignment Overview</h3>
<p>The overall objective of this assignment is to expose you to fold, fold,
    and more fold. And just when you think you've had enough, FOLD.
The assignment is spread over two files 
<a href="misc.ml">misc.ml</a>, <a href="test.ml">test.ml</a>, that you need to download.
The first file contains several skeleton OCaml functions, with missing
bodies, i.e. expressions, which currently contain the text
<code> raise Failure "to be written" </code>. 
Your task is to replace the text in those files with the
the appropriate OCaml code for each of those expressions.
<p><b>Note:</b> All the solutions can be done using the purely
functional fragment of OCaml, using constructs covered in class, and most 
require the use of <i>recursion</i>. 
Solutions using imperative features
such as references or while loops will receive <b>no credit</b>. Feel free
to use any library functions that you want.</p>
It is a good idea to start this assignment early as it is somewhat harder
than the first assignment.</p> 


<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3 align="center">Assignment Testing and Evaluation</h3>
<p>Your functions/programs <b>must</b> compile and/or run on a <b>Linux</b> ACS machine (e.g. <tt> ieng6.ucsd.edu </tt>, 
  as this is where the verification of your solutions will occur. While 
  you may develop your code on any system, ensure that your code runs as 
  expected on an ACS machine prior to submission.
    You should test your code in the directories from 
  which the zip files (see below) will be created, as this will approximate the 
  environment used for grading the assignment.</p>

  <p>Most of the points, except those for comments and style, will be <b>awarded 
  automatically, by evaluating your functions against a given test suite</b>. 
  The fourth file, <tt> test.ml </tt> contains a very small suite of tests which 
  gives you a flavor of of these tests. At any stage, by typing at the UNIX
  shell : <br>
  <blockquote>
    <code> ocaml test.ml | grep "130>>" > log </code>
  </blockquote>
    you will get a report on how your code stacks up against the simple
    tests. 
    </p>
  <p> The last line of the file <tt>log</tt> <b> must contain the word
    "Compiled" otherwise you get a zero for the whole assignment</b>.
  If for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile, leave it as is with the 
  <tt>raise ...</tt>, with your partial solution enclosed below as a comment.
  <b> There will be no exceptions to this rule</b>.
  The second last line of the log file will contain your overall score, and the 
  other lines will give you a readout for each test.
  You are encouraged to try to understand the code in <tt>test.ml</tt>, and
  subsequently devise your own tests and add them to <tt>test.ml</tt>, but
  you will not be graded on this.
</p>
  <p>Alternately, inside the OCaml shell, type (user input is in <font color="#FF000">red</font>):
    <blockquote>
      <code> - <font color="#FF0000"> #use "test.ml";; </font><br>
	.<br>
	.<br>
	.<br>
	- : int * int = (...,...)
     </code>
     </blockquote>
      and it should return a pair of integers, reflecting your score and
      the max possible score on the sample tests. If instead an error
      message appears, your code will receive a zero.
      </p>

<a name="Submission Guidelines"></a>
<h3 align="center">Submission Instructions</h3>
  

<h3>1. Create the zip file for submission</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your solutions to this assignment will be stored in separate 
  files under a directory called <tt>solution/</tt>, inside which you will 
  place the files: <tt> misc.ml</tt>. 
  There should be <b>no other files in the directory</b>.</p>
  
  
  <p>After creating and populating the directory as described above,
  create a zip file called 
  <tt>&lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa3.zip</tt> by going into 
  the directory <tt> solution </tt> and executing
  the UNIX shell command: <br> 
  <blockquote>
    <tt> zip &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa3.zip *</tt>
  </blockquote>

  You can refer to
  an <a href="LastName_FirstName_cse130_pa3.zip">example submission
  file</a> to compare with yours. Make sure that your zipped file's
  structure is the same as the example.
  </blockquote>

<h3>2. Test the zip file to check for its validity</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once you've created the zip file with your solutions, you will
  use the <tt> <a href="validate_pa3"> validate_pa3 </a> </tt> program to see whether your zip
  file's structure is well-formed to be inspected by our grading
  system by executing the UNIX shell command: <br>
  <blockquote><tt> validate_pa3 &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa3.zip </tt>
  </blockquote>
  The <tt>validate_pa3</tt> program will output <tt>OK</tt> if your
  zip file is well-formed and your solution is compiled. 
  Otherwise, it will output some error
  messages. Before going to step 3, make sure that your zip file
  passes <tt>validate_pa3</tt> program. <b>Otherwise 
  you get a zero for the whole assignment.</b>
  If you have any trouble with
  this, refer to the instructions in step 1.
</blockquote>

<h3>3. Submit the zip file via the <tt>turnin</tt> program</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once your zip file passes the validation check
  by <tt>validate_pa3</tt>, you will use the <tt> turnin_pa3</tt> program
  to submit this file for grading by going into the
  directory <tt>solution/</tt> and executing the UNIX shell
  command: <br>
  <blockquote><tt> turnin_pa3
      &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa3.zip </tt>
  </blockquote>
    </p>
  <p>
  The <tt>turnin_pa3</tt> program will provide you with a confirmation of the
  submission process; make sure that the size of the file indicated by
  <tt>turnin_pa3</tt> matches the size of your tar file. (<tt>turnin_pa3</tt> is a thin wrapper script around the ACMS command
  <tt> <a href="http://acms.ucsd.edu/info/turnin.html">turnin</a></tt>
  that repeats validation and ensures that the propper assignment name is passed). Note that you may submit multiple times, but your latest submission overwrites previous submissions, and will be the ONLY one we grade. If you submit before the assignment deadline, and again afterwards, we will count it as if you only submitted after the deadline.

<h2>Problem #1: Warm-Up </a><tt> (misc.ml) </tt></h2>

<h3>(a)<b> 10 points </b></h3>
<p>Fill in the skeleton given for <tt>sqsum </tt>, which uses <tt>List.fold_left</tt> 
to get an OCaml function <tt> sqsum : int list -&gt; int </tt> that
takes a list of integers <tt> [x1;...;xn]) </tt> and returns the integer:
<tt> x1^2 + ... + xn^2 </tt>.
Your task is to fill in the appropriate values for 
(1) the folding function <tt>f</tt> and
(2) the base case <tt>base</tt>.
Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">sqsum [];;</font><br>
    - :  int =  0 <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">sqsum [1;2;3;4] ;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  30 <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">sqsum [-1;-2;-3;-4] ;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  30 <br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(b)<b> 20 points </b></h3>
<p>Fill in the skeleton given for <tt>pipe</tt>, which uses <tt>List.fold_left</tt> 
to get an OCaml function <tt> pipe : ('a -&gt; 'a) list -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'a)
</tt>. The function <tt>pipe</tt> takes a list of functions 
<tt> [f1;...;fn]) </tt> and returns a function <tt>f</tt>
such that for any <tt>x</tt>, the application <tt>f x</tt> returns the
result <tt>fn(...(f2(f1 x)))</tt>.
Again, your task is to fill in the appropriate values for 
(1) the folding function <tt>f</tt> and
(2) the base case <tt>base</tt>.
Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">pipe [] 3;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  3 <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">pipe [(fun x-&gt; 2*x);(fun x -&gt; x + 3)] 3 ;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  9 <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">pipe [(fun x -&gt; x + 3);(fun x-&gt; 2*x)] 3;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  12<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(c)<b> 15 points </b></h3>
<p>Fill in the skeleton given for <tt>sepConcat</tt>, which uses <tt>List.fold_left</tt> to get an OCaml function <tt>sepConcat : string -&gt; string list -&gt; -&gt; string</tt>.  The function <tt>sepConcat</tt> is a curried function which takes as input a string <tt>sep</tt> to be used as a separator, and a list of strings <tt>[s1;...;sn]</tt>.  If there are 0 strings in the list, then <tt>sepConcat</tt> should return <tt>""</tt>.  If there is 1 string in the list, then <tt>sepConcat</tt> should return <tt>s1</tt>.  Otherwise, <tt>sepConcat</tt> should return the concatination <tt>s1 sep s2 sep s3 ... sep sn</tt>.
You should only modify the parts of the skeleton consisting of <tt>failwith "to be implemented"</tt>.  You will need to define the function <tt>f</tt>, and give values for <tt>base</tt> and <tt>l</tt>.
Once you have filled in these parts, you should get the following behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>
# <font color="#FF0000">sepConcat ", " ["foo";"bar";"baz"];;</font><br>
- : string = "foo, bar, baz"<br>
# <font color="#FF0000">sepConcat "---" [];;</font><br>
- : string = ""<br>
# <font color="#FF0000">sepConcat "" ["a";"b";"c";"d";"e"];;</font><br>
- : string = "abcde"<br>
# <font color="#FF0000">sepConcat "X" ["hello"];;</font><br>
- : string = "hello"<br>
</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(d)<b> 5 points </b></h3>
<p>Implement the curried OCaml function <tt>stringOfList : ('a -&gt; string) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; string</tt>.  The first input is a function <tt>f: 'a -&gt; string</tt> which will be called by <tt>stringOfList</tt> to convert each element of the list to a string.  The second input is a list <tt>l: 'a list</tt>, which we will think of as having the elemtns <tt>l1, l2, ..., ln</tt>.  Your <tt>stringOfList</tt> function should return a string representation of the list <tt>l</tt> as a concatenation of the following: "[" (f l1) "; " (f l2) "; " (f l3) "; " ... "; " (f ln) "]".  This function can be implemented on one line without using any recursion by calling <tt>List.map</tt> and <tt>sepConcat</tt> with appropriate inputes.
Once you have completed this function, you should get the following behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>
# <font color="#FF0000">stringOfList string_of_int [1;2;3;4;5;6];;</font><br>
- : string = "[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]"<br>
# <font color="#FF0000">stringOfList (fun x -&gt; x) ["foo"];;</font><br>
- : string = "[foo]"<br>
# <font color="#FF0000">stringOfList (stringOfList string_of_int) [[1;2;3];[4;5];[6];[]];;</font><br>
- : string = "[[1; 2; 3]; [4; 5]; [6]; []]"<br>
</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<hr size=5 noshade>
<h2>Problem #2: Big Numbers <tt> (misc.ml) </tt></h2>

As you may have noticed, the OCaml type <tt> int </tt> only contains values
upto a certain size. For example, entering <tt> 9999999999 </tt> results in
the message <tt> int constant too large </tt>. You will now implement
functions to manipulate large numbers represented as lists of integers.

<h3>(a)<b> 5 + 5 + 5 points</b></h3>
<p>Write a curried function <tt>clone : 'a -&gt; int -&gt; 'a list</tt> which first takes as input <tt>x</tt> and then takes as input an integer <tt>n</tt>.  The result is a list of length <tt>n</tt>, where each element is <tt>x</tt>.   If <tt>n</tt> is 0 or negative, <tt>clone</tt> should return the empty list.  Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>
  # <font color="#FF0000">clone 3 5;;</font><br>
  - :  int list   =  [3; 3; 3; 3; 3] <br>
  # <font color="#FF0000">clone "foo" 2;;</font><br> 
  - :  string list = ["foo"; "foo"]<br>
  # <font color="#FF0000">clone clone (-3);;</font><br> 
  - :  ('_a -&gt; int -&gt; '_a list) list = []<br>
</tt></p>
</blockquote>
	
<p>Use the function <tt> clone </tt> to write a curried function <tt> padZero : int
  list -&gt; int list -&gt; int list  * int list </tt> which takes two lists:
<tt> [x1,...,xn] [y1,...,ym]</tt> and adds zeros in front to make the lists
  equal. Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">padZero [9;9] [1;0;0;2];;</font><br>
    - :  int list * int list   =  ([0;0;9;9],[1;0;0;2]) <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">padZero [1;0;0;2] [9;9];;</font><br> 
    - :  int list * int list =  ([1;0;0;2],[0;0;9;9]) <br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now write a function <tt> removeZero : int list -&gt; int list </tt>, that
takes a list and removes a prefix of trailing zeros. 
Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">removeZero [0;0;0;1;0;0;2];;</font><br>
    - :  int list    =  [1;0;0;2] <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">removeZero [9;9];;</font><br> 
    - :  int list =  [9;9] <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">removeZero [0;0;0;0];;</font><br> 
    - :  int list =  [] <br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(b)<b> 15 points</b></h3>
<p>Suppose we use the list <tt>[d1;d2;d3;...;dn]</tt>, where each <tt> di
</tt> is in the range [0..9], to represent the
(positive) integer <tt>d1d2d3...dn</tt>. For example, the list
<tt>[9;9;9;9;9;9;9;9;9;9]</tt> represents the integer 9999999999.
Fill out the implementation for <tt> bigAdd : int list -&gt; int list -&gt;
  int list </tt>, so that it takes two integer lists, where each
integer is in the range [0..9] and returns the list corresponding to the
addition of the two big integers. Again, you have to fill in the
implementation to supply the appropriate values to <tt> f, base, args </tt>.
Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">bigAdd [9;9] [1;0;0;2];;</font><br>
    - :  int list   =  [1;1;0;1] <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">bigAdd [9;9;9;9] [9;9;9];;</font><br> 
    - :  int list  =  [1;0;9;9;8] <br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(c)<b> 10 + 10 points </b></h3>
<p> Next you will write functions to multiply two big integers. First write
a function <tt> mulByDigit : int -&gt; int list -&gt; int list </tt> which
takes an integer digit and a big integer, and returns the
big integer list which is the result of multiplying the big integer with
the digit. Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">mulByDigit 9 [9;9;9;9];;</font><br> 
    - :  int list  =  [8;9;9;9;1] <br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>
Now, using the function <tt>mulByDigit</tt>, fill in the implementation of
<tt>bigMul : int list -&gt; int list -&gt; int list </tt>. Again,
you have to fill in implementations for <tt> f , base , args </tt> only.
Once you are done, you should get the following behavior at the prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">bigMul [9;9;9;9] [9;9;9;9];;</font><br> 
    - :  int list  =  [9;9;9;8;0;0;0;1] <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">bigMul [9;9;9;9;9] [9;9;9;9;9];;</font><br> 
    - :  int list  =  [9;9;9;9;8;0;0;0;0;1] <br>
 </tt></p>
